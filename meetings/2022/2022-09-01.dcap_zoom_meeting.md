## Participants

* John, Karen, Tom, Phil, Nishad

## Agenda

**From last meeting**
* edits to Primer for `langString` and some copy edits
    * [Diff](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/commit/18cb0b02513540d0ff9be877c4bf849e8365b4fc)
* Some questions about [shapes section](https://hackmd.io/DErWH403RaWiBippMFosaw?view#Shapes) in Primer

**[Cookbook](https://hackmd.io/V3LGdBdxTrOid57M2wJUlw)**
Right now is organized into sections "added values" and "added columns" which probably is not the user view. What criteria should we use for ordering? An "I want to ..."? Simple to complex? What should we say are methods? (e.g. multiple values in a cell; repeating properties for added constraints; etc.)

Minutes: 

Tom: We should publish "talking about metadata" document. But where?

kc: could create section on profiles in general with prior work and TAP.

ACTION on All: Look at site and think about where to put our documents.

Once published, needs a short announcement explaining WHY

PRIMER - Shapes section

ACTION: kc - fix case problems in shape examples (and check examples in github)

ACTION: kc - move repetition of shapes in rows to appendix.

phil: combine value shape and shapeID in section and text?

John: Examples: first show as strings, then "when you need to say more" introduces shapes

Shapes and properties:
Phil: "The string in the valueShape column is a shapeID that indicates the shape defintion used to constrain the value of property."

or: "The string in the valueShape column is the same as a shapeID of a shape definition in the TAP. (The shape definition used to constrain the value of property.?)

provides a shape definition as the value of the property

john: defines a shape block in the TAP

Cookbook:

Needs to be re-organized to reflect user view, not extending elements and extending table. Karen and Phil need to talk.

Notes: 01:05:09	John Huck:	I like Phil's solution (connects the value of the property to a shape)
01:05:31	Phil Barker:	The string in the valueShape column is used to constrain the value of property by reference to a shape defintion.
01:06:02	Phil Barker:	The string in the valueShape column is used to constrain the value of property by reference to a shape defintion using a shapeID
01:08:41	Karen Coyle:	https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/talking_about_metadata.md
01:10:17	Phil Barker:	The string in the valueShape column is a shapeID that indicates the shape defintion used to constrain the value of property.
01:10:39	Karen Coyle:	thanks phil. copied it
