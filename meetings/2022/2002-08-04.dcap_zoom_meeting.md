## Agenda

**XSD values for valueConstraintType**

At the last meeting we agreed that some addition XSD value constraint types are useful, and we reviewed the min/max length and totals. Which (if any) of these should we add to the Primer? Which should be included in examples in the Cookbook?

Here's what's in XSD:
**string** has the following [路constraining facets路](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-constraining-facet):

-   [length](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-length)
-   [minLength](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-minLength)
-   [maxLength](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-maxLength)
-   [pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-pattern)
-   [enumeration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-enumeration)
-   [whiteSpace](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-whiteSpace)

**decimal** has the following [路constraining facets路](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-constraining-facet):

-   [totalDigits](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-totalDigits)
-   [fractionDigits](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-fractionDigits)
-   [pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-pattern)
-   [whiteSpace](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-whiteSpace)
-   [enumeration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-enumeration)
-   [maxInclusive](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-maxInclusive)
-   [maxExclusive](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-maxExclusive)
-   [minInclusive](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-minInclusive)
-   [minExclusive](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#rf-minExclusive)

**Edits to Primer**
* [diff](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/commit/6d6ee8ffb1920665f7c52adfc9d464f88f5ed58b)
* Main changes: 
    * using statement template (ln 253)
    * filled out (most of) new example table
    * shapes (296 and on)

**TAP structure and metadata structure**

See [issue #76](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/76)

## Minutes

Discussion of min/max - adding these to the Primer. 
to add:
* minlength/maxlength
* minInclusive/maxInclusive

phil: not wild about minI/maxI but have to use because used all over. Point to reference, and give the most frequent

kc: Inclusives are probably the most used, so those will be added

nishad: min and minInclusive are different in XML.

kc: leave Primer as minI/maxI, and in the cookbook refer to the others

nishad: could also use shex/shacl if that's what people are using

kc: perhaps have sections in cookbook for shex and shacl, giving advice for people using those.

Edits to Primer 
* multiple values in cells
* uses term "statement templates"
* beginning new example table using book and author
* needs something else?

Phil: did book/author diagram. publisher would add another shape of the same (RDF) class. Diagrams include display names and cardinality to be more expressive

ACTION: kc to add publisher as another shape

Issue #76 - same property as calling property and in shape.

kc: this began with the requirement of having a subject that can be an IRI or a literal. I first thought of this as a shape. Phil has shown how these can be handled on subsequent rows within the same main shape.

phil: not sure if subject describes a node

kc: dct:subject points to a blank node and that blank node has two non-mandatory instances of dct:subject - one that is an IRI and one that is a literal.

Phil: You could do that - but is that how you want your RDF to look?

kc: not likely. But what if you also wanted to encode the source of the subject heading that is a literal? That has to be connected to the statement template that is a literal subject, and each literal subject would have to have its own source.

phil: that isn't a problem; I've come across that a lot when working with schema.org model because in that model properties often get used in many different contexts and ways. So sdo:name is both a book title and the name of a company. This isn't a problem because they are in different nodes so you can give them their own constraints. 

kc: other examples: dct:date, dct:description. Used in many contexts

kc: next question - not for a solution but for ideas on how to talk about it: to what extent is the TAP conceptual and to what extent does it reflect the structure of the metadata? Will those creating the TAP know how the metadata will ultimately be structured?

phil: understanding from trying to turn TAP into SHACL. Also inherent in terminology - a row is a statement template = a statement is a structure in the metadata. And a shape groups related statements, so a shape relates to the shacl node shapes. 

kc: TAP probably will not give same detail as SHACL or ShEx. We should have called it "Simple Tabular Application Profile" format.

Nishad: AP is a superset of validation, as is CSV. TAP is a starting point, a modeling language. But is a level higher than Sh/SHACL because it is more human readable. 

kc: do we need to say something about how the TAP relates to the structure in the metadata? we haven't said that the shapes in TAP = the shapes in metadata

Nishad: I don't like the idea of shapes. Validation is like a cookie-cutter; the AP is more than validation and gives additional information. More related to use of shape and what it is meant for. 

Phil: I agree - TAP is more than validation. But I have created SHACL from TAPs. I wouldn't want that reversed.

Nishad: We can say that TAP is *more* than a validation language, but it can also support validation.

kc: TAP may be at a higher level than validation - a community agreement that needs to be more specific for validation.

phil: shape is the only thing that comes up both in metadata and TAP. 

kc: maybe add to cookbook: shape = 'object' in JSON, 'entity' in XML. Also note that JSON is possibly the most common metadata format (at least for applications)

nishad: APs are often just documents

phil: in primer we talk about structure of the data (and also the concepts) e.g. nodes, edges, etc. 

kc: we never say that the TAP structure is also the structure of the metadata. Do we need to say something about that? Or not say anything? Will all TAPs describe structure?

nishad: json-ld is a serialization of RDF. Best not to get into serializations. 

phil: we have described TAP as nodes and arcs, but we want also to support tree structures. The framework document is where we make that clear. 

kc: need to speak to people in terms they understand, and many understand only the language of XML or of JSON. 

Phil: Not on next call.

Phil: leave this ambiguous, and clarify elsewhere
