### URI as value datatype - [github issue](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/issues/70)

Also see start of this discussion in [issue 68](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/issues/68)

In short, can we define a data type "URI" to be entered in the value datatype column?

a. 
|RDF value type|value datatype|
|----|----|
|URI|URI|

b.
|RDF value type|value datatype|
|----|----|
|URI||

14:53

Karen asks Nishad his thoughts on github issue 70.

Nishad: It's too much diverse at this point. Datatypes are like typed literals in RDF concept. So when you declare a type it's actually the literal by itself, so technically IRIs doesn't need to have a datatype for bnode. So I agree with Tom's idea.

16:20
Karen: Here are the three possible options (on the agenda) for doing IRIs. If the dataype is always liternals, where do we put IRI or URI. We can have it as the "RDF value type" (column heading) and have no datatype. We coud allow IRI to be in the value datatype, even though it isn't [unclear].

16:53
But that means there may also be an RDF value type that is the same. Or we can allow people to place it in the value type. The question is, ... whether we think people can use the datatype column by itself without using the RDF type column.

17:26
Tom: I think we might be getting hung up on this term datatype. Because datatype means in a general sense the type of in this case, the value. But it has a very specific meaning in RDF. RDF datatype is only for literals. I think what I hear you saying is that there needs to be a way to record in an informal way what kind of value you should expect. A date, a URI, or whatever.

Karen: Exactly. And that's what we initially intended that column to be. So if you look at our resolutions and examples we've done in the past, that was the sense of it.

18:44

Tom: In my code I called that value type, not value datatype.

Karen: Right. Well it was value type. If you look at the resolutions, "value type" was the "expected data type", not put together as one word, but the type of the data in the instance data. Then Phil started using value type for the RDF node type. So it kind of got hijacked. 

Tom: We've gotten this twisted up. 

Karen: Which I think is too bad, because I think just a plain "value type" would be good.

Tom: Was it Ben who pointed out that some things explain and some things constrain. Maybe that was Nishad. 

Karen: That was Nishad.

Tom: I really liked that actually. It occurs to me, if you say that the datatype is a literal, is xsd:date, you are constraining. A validator will look in the data to see if it's xsd:date. But if you just say the expected value is a date, you're really just explaining it. And you might have a community specific way of defining what a date is. But if you just say it's a date, you're not providing some sort of information that can be used for validation without further information.

20:44

That's what I was getting at with this notion that... Well, two things: Some people will not know what an RDF value type is. The other thing is this desire to have this column that lets you explain what the expected value is without necessarily having that be translated into some sort of algorithmic matching... in the posting I made to the issue, you can have dc:date, and then you could give a regex that gives you your [unclear] date, or you could say that it must be tagged with the RDF datatype for xsd:date, or maybe there just needs to be a column where you say, "it's a date!" It's not necessarily a date in an actionable sense. You're just informing people that the expected value is a date. That could be something like "value" label, but you were saying, Karen, that this is arguable the function of a property label, because a property label gives hints very often.
  
23:09

Karen: Well the property label is what you would show to a person in a display. We have an annotation column. If you want to just say this is a date, you can use the annotation column. [Tom: Right, that's another way to do it.] And our Datatype, we had agreed that we would use, as a default, xsd types. But they wouldn't necessarily all be xsd types. You wouldn't need to put the "xsd:" there. 

Tom: Oh, I don't remember not saying that you wouldn't not need to use the "xsd:". 

Karen: That's why we did the Doodle poll choosing which ones we think we would emphasize in the basic documentation. So we would have duration, date, string, decimal, anyURI. So that's what we were aiming at prior to the discussion coming up with the problem that anyURI is a literal. 

24:45

Tom: Yeah, if I agreed to that, (I might have agreed to that), I don't think I fully understood... I think it makes sense to have a column which is only for datatypes. And I'm not sure it's a good idea to take of the "xsd:" part. But if it's only datatype, it's only literals. I'm surprised that so many people voted for anyURI, because anyURI is really not saying that the value is an entity, a resource, as opposed to literal, it's saying that the entity is a string that meets the definition of a URI.

25:50

Karen: Right. Here's what I copied from the OWL documentation. I went through XML Schema, RDF Schema types, nodes, SHACL, ShEx, etc. I went through them all. So we have links here to how they define types. So we've got the node kinds, the SHACL node kinds, which are very different to the ShEx node kinds, by the way.  So these are the node kinds in SHACL (shows documentation). 

Tom: It's not that much different.

Karen: Yes, it is quite different. It's blank node or IRI, blank node or literal, IRI or literal.

Tom: It's just the same thing as ShEx, except for having a different term for the combinations.

Karen: ShEx doesn't have "IRI or Literal." (Karen clarifies that she means the combination). 

John: And that's a use case that I have come across.

Karen: that we need, ya.

Nishad: I also have that use case.

Tom: Yeah, but do you need to declare that it's either an IRI or a literal? As opposed to leaving it unspecified?

Karen: Yeah. Unspecified may also be a blank node and you may not accept a blank node.

John: I came up with a few different options for how to handle that use case in my gitHub comment. I was thinking along those lines too. 

Karen: So in terms of whether any URI can be used, I found this in the OWL documentation, and as is almost always the case, makes almost no sense to me. I'm not an artificial intelligence researcher. But OWL says, according to XML Schema, the value space of anyURI, is the set of all IRIs. Although each IRI has a string representation, IRIs are not strings. The value space of xsd:anyURI can therefore be seen as an isomorphic copy of a subset of the value space of xsd:string. Does anyone have any idea what that means?

Nishad: Yeah, a clear example was given by Phil. For example, you have a string. You are expecting a URL or a URI as a string. For example you are referencing an organization, an organization website and it's a string. Or a contact, a contact may be an [email?] for a website. So sometimes we need a textual representation, which is actually IRI, but just a textual representation of a URI. So that makes perfect sense.

Karen: The way you say it makese sense to me. Can we define a value type that can include URI? In other words, can our value type not be strictly limited to xsd value type and RDF value type, but simply saying, what are you expecting to get here?

30:36

Tom: I think so. By saying that the value should be an integer, do you really mean to imply that the usage data should have integers tagged with the URI for the RDF datatype xsd:integer? (the caret, caret format)

Karen: You know, that's almost never used, you almost never see it in live data, and the RDF Schema document says that that is optional. They say something about being syntactic sugar for... [checks for document]... But they basically say, in theory, you have a string, a datatype, and then possibly a language code and they say that basically, the datatype and the language code are optional.

[John interjects momentarily]

[Found documentation] Karen: so this is how literals are handled in RDF, so it's a lexical form, a datatype IRI, and then possibly a language tag. And it says, "Concrete syntaxes may support simple literals consisting only of the lexical form without any datatype IRI or language tags. Some literals are syntactic sugar for abstract syntax literals with the datatype IRI... string. Similarly, most concrete syntaxes represent language tag strings without the datatype IRI because it equals [unsure] string. So it seems it is considered okay to not use this caret, caret form.

33:49

Tom: Well, only in the case of string and language string. Those are special cases.  They are like defaults. [Karen: right. I almost never see this form]. If we have a list of these things, we can say they are... We shouldn't imply that these are xsd URIs that are just depicted with the right-hand part of the [unsure].

Karen: the "xsd:" in terms of the default prefix

Tom: No, I think that's a bad idea, because... I think it's one thing to say here's a set of starter types, they're based on XSD, so you can look to the definition of an integer in XML Schema, and you'll see

35:23

And you'll see what an integer is. It's another thing to imply that these are shorthands for URIs, because the URI xsd:string does not, it's not like the name of a class, it's not a class string. And literals that are tagged with XSD string are not somehow members of a class. And we shouldn't imply that when you see integer you should read it as xsd:integer. We can say that if you see integer, look for a definition of integer in XML Schema.

I think this gets back to Nishad's distinction between explaining and constraining. I think if we say that something is an integer, we're explaining. And we're giving a hint to somebody who might write an application using the application profile that this needs to be handled as an integer. But we're not saying that the data needs to be tagged with these xsd URIs. 37:11

Because you yourself say they're often implicit, they're not used in a lot of data.

John: I think it comes back to the comment I wanted to make earlier. That distinction between constraining and explaining. Conceptually, it's great for us to talk about, but I think if we're basing the structure of things that we're defining now on that, it's a concept that other people won't have access to in order to understand the table. And what people do understand are datatypes. And it seems that there's a tug of war between where the literal datatypes should go. Whether they should be in their own column or whether they should be in the column to the left or whether they should be in the constraints to the right. I think it's going to be less confusing if turns out we have to combine them with the... and consider them alongside, you know: URI, blank node, literal datatypes--you know you could make that one category. The reason I keep thinking about that is because after you define that datatype, you might want to define another type of constraint, and if you start mixing literal datatypes with constraint types, then you can't have both. 

Tom: Well, as I say, I think you could have a column where you have things like date and integer, but if you want to express the idea that you expect the data, the literals of date to be tagged with xsd:date, then you would use the combination of constraint type and constraint value to express that, because you would explicitly say that you would expect to see the, you know... In some data you expect the language strings to be tagged with language tags. And so you can say that explicitly using constraint type, constraing value. 

Karen: Tom, we've already I think established that if you use xsd:date as the constraint or the constraint type...

Tom: Constraint type would be RDF datatype.

Karen: RDF datatype... But then you cannot do other constraints on the date, such as saying, it can't be greater than 2020. [crosstalk] We were having a datatype, and then constraint on a datatype. By putting datatype in constraint, you can't do constraint.

Tom: That's true, but I thought you were saying that these xsd: URIs are not frequently used in data.

Karen: The caret, caret isn't frequently used.

Tom: That's what it means.

Karen: However, people say: this is a date of the form xsd:date without doing the caret, caret. In other words, the difference is whether it's in your profile or if it's in your data.

Tom: Well, whether it's in your profile as an annotation.

Karen: Ok, so there's two things, and I think we're confusing them. One is that the formulation of the string datatype, which has caret, caret. The other thing is, what's in the string. So xsd:date defines what's in the string. So when you're saying the constraint type is xsd:date, you're talking about the string rather than the formulation of the xsd:date as a URI. And I think what we should be talking about is, what do you mean by date? And that's defined in xsd. (YYYY, etc.) We're looking for that definition. And to say that you have to formulate it as a certain URI, I'm not sure that meshes with reality.

Tom: No, I'm not suggesting that you would normally tag these things as xsd:date. I don't know what the practice is. I'm sure it's different from field to field. But I don't think that one should infer that... that people should assume that the string is tagged with xsd:date. We could leave that up to implementers. If implementers want to tell their programmers that when it's a date, that you really should expect an xsd:date there as an RDF datatype. But I don't think it crosses the line between explaining and constraining.

Karen: Well, I think there is overlap between explaining and constraining. I think we need to live with that.

Tom: This goes to the idea of defaults, and I thought we were generally against defaults and now it seems to me that you're saying that we should be encouraging people to think that there are these implicit defaults.

Karen: We did at one point decide that the default for the type column would use xsd. So we can undecide that if we want, but that was a decision that was made. 

Tom: I don't remember agreeing to that. Anyway, I disagree with it now (laughing).

Karen: That's fine, but that was the working assumption. So if that's not going to be our working assumption, we have to figure out a way... So the idea being, since these were defined... [looks for document]

... So here are the datatypes. This is as XML. XSD. It gets more complicated when you move into RDF, because RDF requires these to be URIs, which they weren't initially. But if you say date, and it's going to match xsd:date , that would give you an actual...

Tom: A definition.

Karen: A definition. We were looking for a definition, not 'this is how you have to express it as an RDF URI'. [...] Use the definitions from xsd datatypes.

Tom: Yeah, that's what I was agreeing to before. But not implying that when you read "date" assume that this requires the use of the URI xsd:date. 

Karen: Right, exactly. Does anyone else think that wasn't what we were going for?

[clarifying] Does anyone disagree with what Tom just said. 

John: I'm a little confused, I'm not I know exactly where Tom has landed, but for me the idea has always been that we refer out to a definition to say, the datat will fit this form. What the string will look like.

Nishad: All XML datatypes are not RDF types. Some XML types are actually skipped from RDF. And also, RDF proposed two additional datatypes. rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral. In RDF, 3 or 4 specific XML types were removed. One more use case is this rdf:HTML has a fairly big use case. For instance if you take even the schema.org [unclear] you can see the definition in html. That's an rdf:HTML. So when you write definitions, most of the RDF [unclear] datasets have this rdf:HTML.

We are trying to adopt more RDF specific [unclear], so I agree with Tom that you can actually say it is RDF, it should be an RDF type from the RDF specification, not from the XML specification. And RDF specification actually clarifies that only these things come from XML namespace and additional two from different URIs. The clarification is there in RDF datatypes.

49:54
Karen: And yet the RDF specification simply refers to the xsd types. It basically imports them. And it's in the xsd document that they are defined. So we're wanting people to use valid RDF types, but we would have to refer to the xsd documentation for them to see what they are. So one thing we could do is, in the user documentation we can refer to the RDF datatypes, we can give some examples. And our examples... that what we would get from our Doodle poll. We would say you can use date, and then point to the xsd definition of date. If you use string, we point to that definition of string. We would tell people where to find the definitions for these. And that they can use any of these, anything that is valid in RDF as a datatype. Does that work?

Nishad: That an easiest option to do it. But as Tom recommended, it's always good to have a prefix for the datatypes, so they have a  qualified name than just a string, but to simplify things. For example you are writing a property, you can assume the default is xsd, so you can just type date, that's also fine, in my understanding. Because you are simplifying the whole idea of writing complex things.

Tom: As long as we don't imply that this means this is declaring the xsd datatypes as constraints that should be in the data. Because I think we agreed that in many or most cases it won't be. In other words, say that date is defined as in XML Schema, but don't imply that the URI for XSD date is being used as an RDF datatype to type the literal.

Karen: Right. 53:17

Nishad: If we try to express the property in ShEx or RDF, we actually prefix it with xsd, if there is no prefix.

Tom: Yeah, but you would do that if you expected it to be a type literal. You wouldn't do that if you just expected a literal to match in a general sense the definition of xsd:date. If you expected to find the rdf datatype xsd:date in the data, then you would specify it in ShEx. Otherwise you wouldn't, I don't think. 

Nishad: Yeah, because it's a [unclear], so when you express it in a constraint or a validation language you actually have to [unclear] the type constraint which is actually a URI.

Tom: Yeah, if you expect to find it in the data, you mean. If you're validating the data for the presence of these xsd datatype tags.

Nishad: Yes.

Tom: If you're not expecting that, you wouldn't put that into a validation schema. There's nothing about xsd:date that would... You can say with words, yes, the date should conform to the definition of xsd:date, but you're not expecting to find xsd:date in the data used as an RDF datatype. And so it wouldn't be in the ShEx schema either, because there's nothing to test for. Either you test for the presence of an xsd type or you don't. It's just a literal, and that's it.

Nishad: When the property [?] has a datatype, then definitely the validation schema should also carry forward that. Because the constraint is already there. So it can be used as a validation schema.

Karen: So could you put in your constraint the date?

Nishad: Yeah, because the datatype is a constrainer that the type should be this specific type. So it's constrainer. [unclear] But you can use it as a validation. Because it's a constrainer so the data should always conform to the constrainer.

Tom: Yeah. 

Karen: So now I'm confused about what column you're using. So you're saying a person can say date in the type column, and what then would be in the constraint column?

Nishad; Um, no, the date is only one [audio drop] There is only one datatype which is actually date. If it's date, it is actually xsd:date. We always interest them to write the fully qualified xsd:date itself. But what I was [unsure], if we cannot actually enforce everyone to use xsd:date, but we infer that, it is actually xsd:date if it says date. Anyway it is actually xsd:date, because in our specification we recommend that it should be and it is [unsure]. So everything should be an RDF tag. So if you're right [audio drops]

Nishad: The idea is actually when you have datatype, which is actually RDF datatype ...

Karen: So what would people put in the datatype column for date? Would they put xsd:date

Nishad: xsd:date is what we recommend. But if there is no prefix, we assume that is is xsd.

Karen: So that was the thing that Tom was having trouble with.

Tom: No, but I think I heard you saying, Nishad, that you want to encourage people to type their literals. To have typed literals. Is that right?

Nishad: Yes. For that we have the datatype column. 

Tom: And that's a datatype column for literal datatypes. 

Nishad: Yes.

Tom: Yeah. OK. We're still not quite aligned here. Also because I think Karen is suggesting the opposite, that we don't want to encourage people to type their literals necessarily. Only if they want to. 

Nishad: Only if they want to, because the default is xsd:string.

Tom: Ah, defaults, ok, now we're talking about defaults. 

Karen: The default is you don't know.  The default ends up being the same as OWL annotation property, which is basically "whatever".

Nishad: A string.

Karen: It's a set of characters. It'a an alphanumeric something. Some unicode. In a sense, yes, it's a string, but you could interpret it as a URI if it starts http:// ... which is also a string. Everything is a string.

Nishad: Only IRI or Bnode they were not typed. If it is a literal, which is default, then it is typed.

Karen: Right, so then where do we put IRI and Bnode.

Nishad: [unsure]. So I think that model B is perfect. If it is IRI, then there is no datatype. It is just IRI. So you can leave the cell empty. If it is bnode, still you can leave the cell empty. If it is string, you can go ahead with defaults. If it is literal, you can go ahead and define as literal if you want.

Karen: So, in the RDF type, we're going to have literal, IRI and Bnode.

Nishad: Yes, and there comes the problem, which John also arrived [write?] which is what if we say, IRI or literal? So for the whole profile sometimes we need to define an OR operator somehow, so that it is really useful sometimes. Say for example, Use case, let's say multiple type of [term?]... properties. [unsure]Book or [unsure]Movie. So how do you define that OR? An OR operator [unsure] helping these sort of [unsure].

Karen: So we had talked about using the OR style from ShEx, which is basically a blank. Can't remember if things have to be in square brackets. It's just a blank tokenizer. [and treats it as a rule?]

John: Phil has added some options to answer this question to the github issue 70.

Tom: That's interesting. But Nishad, just to be clear, what you're saying is that value datatype is a column about literals.

Nishad: Yes. Because we need only typing for literals. We don't need typing for any other [unsure]. It's only applicable for literal. But since we have a spreadsheet model, we can just keep a column [unsure] IRI and bnode, we just leave it empty, it's not applicable. But again, there is some interesting use cases. If you have constraint, you can still add IRIstem constraint for an IRI.

Karen: Without saying that it's an IRI in the...?

Nishad: Because we already said it's an IRI in the [third?] column. On Karen's screen you have an example, just before Phil's comment. Ya, the third column we are actually defining whether it is a literal or an IRI. Then probably on constraint, I think on constraint you can bring [unsure], because constraint is not only for datatype, it is for IRI, so you can write an IRIStem. And constrain that IRI there. Which is a valid constraint. 

Karen: But could you do that if you didn't have IRI in the value type column?

Nishad: If there is no IRI in value type, then it is literal by default. But still again you can type, you can bring your constraint that it can have an IRI [stem?] too. If it is valid. But it is not treated as an IRI, it is a string. Say for example, a URL, you can constrain as an IRI. Say for example, profile. You are expecting orcidID property, you can say it should be an ORCID ID [unsure]. which is still a literal. But if it's IRI, it is constrained as an IRIstem, which is treated like an IRI. 

1:04:53  

Karen: I will need some examples, Nishad, because I still can't figure out if you're saying you don't fill in... Let's say you don't include the value RDF type column. All our columns are optional, except property ID. If you don't include that can you still have datatype and constraint? 

Nishad: The [unsure] constraint [unsure] declared, but we can say by default it is a literal for value type.

Tom: If you take the example that's up on the screen now, you put your hand over value RDF type, you just see a constraint type of regex. It could be part of the definition of the constraint type. We'll have to have a set of... We're creating these constraint types. And so they have to be defined somewhere. And it could be defined as a regular expression to which a literal value must conform. In that case you could infer without stating it that the value rdf type is literal. In the documenation for my program, I provide some examples where I think one can infer the information like that. So it depends on how you define the constraint type.

Karen: It's a shame that Phil isn't here, because we got the "value rdf type" column explicitly because he did not want to infer from the datatype.

John: The solution that Phil suggested on the github issue of merging "value rdf type" and the "datatype" columns, my thinking is going in that direction too, just because, for constraint type, we know that even if something is an IRI, we might want to constrain it by saying it's an IRIstem, so it seems to me that constraint could apply either to string or literals [I meant IRIs or literals] or even blank nodes, I guess. To me it makes sense that you can have more and less specific strings (literals) and declare that within that one column.

Karen: So in Phil's example, he says both entity and bnode. He says two things. Are you saying that we would have to say two things in that one column? Or that's what's to the right here could be in a single column and stand alone?

John: It could either be that what's listed there on both sides of the dash is in one column, or we could come back to splitting it into two columns, but the first column is basically a boolean. It's either an entity or a literal. So that one column would have either one or the other value. And then everything to the right would be in a separate column. But if the first column would either be entity or a literal, does it make sense to have a separate column for that or just to have this menu of options within one column.

Karen: OK, if it's one column, do you have to say entity or literal before each thing? Are there any places where it would be ambiguous?

John: In my mind, the reason that he added that prefix, if you want to call it that, is partly to clarify that "entity - either" or "literal - any" that these values have a relationship to other values in the list. In the sense that they encompass. That they are more general. They have subsets. You have sets and subsets within the list there. And so having "IRI or literal" would be another grouping within that list. You have the sets and subsets within the same list. 

Tom: It seems like it's opening a can of worms to try to combine things like this.

Karen: Yeah, I don't like the combination, but what I do find interesting is that this entity, literal, the vision is basically OWL. It's object property or data property. And many people will be familiar with those. Because a lot of people are using things like Protege or Top Braid to do their data definition and so they're familiar with those OWL definitions.

John: So maybe two columns and the first column is entity, literal, or entity-or-literal and the second column is everything else we're talking about. URI, blank node and then the xsd datatypes. That would accomplish the same thing. 

Karen: That wouldn't give you bnode. Oh, bnode would be in the type column. We need to write this up as a proposal.

Tom: Who is making this proposal, besides Phil? Does anyone think this is a good idea? I think it's an interesting idea, but I don't think it's a good idea.

Karen: Which idea?

Tom: Putting everyting into one column.

Karen: We're talking about two columns. One would say entity, and then the other would say either URI or bnode.

John: I'm leaning in the direction Phil first started here, merging the two columns into one and what I proposed just here is a variation on this idea to address the concern that folks today have about having them in one column.

Tom: I really have to go.

Karen: We are over time.  I will do an example here in this issue. I don't know what we have resolved here other than thinking that pointing people to the definitions of the strings , of the datatypes in xsd. John you'll listen to this one and figure out what we decided. We'll try to get what Nishad said in terms of how we're defining the datatypes. He had a very good clear thing there about any valid RDF datatype, ya, you'll get it.
