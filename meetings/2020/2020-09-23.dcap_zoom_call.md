## Discussion
(*Note that "entity" and "shape" are used interchangeably throughout in transcription, linked examples, etc.*)
- Karen: Goals for today: Decide on column headers, get started on documentation, move towards an 'alpha' rollout
- K: There has been some discussion about whether we need more than one label column or not, what column headers will be, etc.
- K: Label column or column***s***--are there advocates for a single label column \[as opposed to both an "entity label"-type column and a "property label"-type column\]?
    - Nishad: +1 for just one label column
    - K: OK, so then, where would it be? How would it work?
    - N: Anywhere, because as per our \[earlier\] decision, the order of the columns is not important. One label column per row--the label column indicates whatever is in the row.
    - K: I believe [I showed what that might look like](https://hackmd.io/@kcoyle/rJIw0lK4v), and it was a bit awkward, because you could have a property label appearing before the property itself depending on the column order
    - Phil: But the ordering of the columns doesn't matter
    - Tom: But I think Phil and Nishad's point, and I agree, is that we can suggest a conventional ordering of the columns, but the model shouldn't depend on the order of the columns
    - P: I'd suggest "shape ID," "property ID," "label" as a default order
    - T: The problem I have with that is that it assumes that one would put the "shape ID" onto a separate row, which makes sense if you are thinking about looking at a CSV as a display \[of the AP\], but what about creating structure by putting the "shape ID" in every row before the property, giving context to the statements. If there is only one label column, this wouldn't be possible, because you couldn't give both the shape label and the property label for a given row.
    - P: That's true, that's the tradeoff. I don't really mind which way we go, but trying to allow for both \[specifying both the shape and the property in every row, or not\] seems to be problematic.
    - T: You mean catering both to putting shapes on their own row and \[specifying them in rows with properties\]?
    - P: We probably could facilitate having it either way, but if there is only one way to do something, we only need to solve for one option
- N: In previous discussions about CSV, my argument was that each row should have only one type of thing in it. So for example, [what we are seeing on the screen right now](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv) violates this, because [row 2](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv#L2) has an entity as well as a property. As discussed before, in order to align with CSV parsers, it is better to have only one type of thing in a single row--if a row defines an entity, that's all that is in it, and properties will be on separate rows.
    - P: I found that slightly easier to parse.
    - N: At that time, we also discussed that this would allow for specification of cardinality options for entities
    - P: I also find it more readable
- T: Looking at [csv2shex](https://csv2shex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), you can get the same result whether you declare entities [on separate rows](https://csv2shex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/shape.html) or [in statement rows](https://csv2shex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/shape_variant.html). So it would seem that this isn't a difficult problem, although in some situations there might be conflicting or redundant labels. So I don't see why this wouldn't work, and it would support both patterns of use. So in one pattern you might generate statements with the shape IDs in them, in another you might author a CSV by hand and put shapes in their own row. 
- K: So the main argument for keeping separate label columns is greater clarity about whether the label is for a shape or a property. Since the order doesn't matter, having each label be clearly defined and not dependent on other factors is clearer. I don't see a downside for having two label columns.
    - P: How about the point that Nishad made--if you want a particular shape to be mandatory or non-repeatable, will we have separate cardinality columns for shapes? If we do that, we'll probably need a separate sheet for the shapes.
    - K: Those columns are there, and they aren't ambiguous to me
    - P: They are just as ambiguous as a single label column would be
    - K: I don't see why having two label columns is problematic
    - N: There is no technical reason why a label column or an annotation column should be repeated
    - K: But depending on where you place the label column, you could end up with it preceeding the property
    - P: But that's just a display issue
    - T: I take Phil and Nishad's point that a program might want to normalize a particular sequence of columns, but there shouldn't be any restrictions on the order of columns
    - K: There aren't any restrictions on the order, but it should look logical to the person creating \[the AP\]
    - P: But thinking about [what we have on the screen at the moment](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv), how do I know whether "mandatory: y" on line 2 refers to the entity or the property?
    - T: I was assuming in this case that "mandatory" and "repeatable" would refer only to the property
    - P: So are you saying that the shape has to be on its own row?
    - K: I don't see how we could do things like "mandatory," "repeatable," and "annotation" if \[shapes aren't on their\] own row
- T: I've thought of mandatory and repeatable as applying only to properties; if you have a value which needs to conform to a shape, that shape \[as a value\] takes its cardinality from the cardinality for the property
    - K: There's only going to be one shape that is not the object of some other statement, so that would be the one that might need mandatory and repeatable
    - P: But there will be other examples of graphs that have more than one top-level entity; surely you could have two different object types at the top level of a graph
    - K: But we are targeting the simplest common practice; there will be things that we do not support in our template
    - K: We have said that the shape can be on its own row
    - T: But we have not said that a shape *must* be on it's own row
    - K: Right, I don't know that we ever did say that
- P: We would simplify things if we said that the shape must be on it's own row; then the mandatory and repeatable columns on that row would unambiguously refer to the shape, likewise the annotation and label; as soon as you allow the option to have the shape and the property on the same row, then you have to write in a separate rule to say that if the entity doesn't appear on its own \[row\], then it can't have its own label, annotation, mandatory, repeatable, etc. unless you repeat those columns; so I don't see the objection to saying "let's put the shape on it's own row"
    - T: It means that you're making the association of a statement with a particular shape dependent on sequence; that's fine, you can always insert a row in a speadsheet, but I thought we were entertaining the idea that there would be other ways to generate data according to this model, and we wouldn't be dependent on sequence 
    - P: That use case comes up if you want to append things to a CSV file as you go along, I think in that case you'd have to have multiple blocks for a particular shape--split the statements about a shape into multiple blocks
    - Ben: But looking again at [the example](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv#L2), don't the title and date statements on rows 3 and 4 already depend on sequence to be associated with the Book entity?
    - T: Well, no, you could fill in the "entity ID" column in each row, we've just omitted that in the example
- K: We've talked about the columns not being in a fixed order, now we are getting to the point of saying "what about the rows"?
    - K: There could be properties that you could use anywhere; the library world has this idea of "free-floaters," you couldn't put those at the bottom because then they would be associated with the previous entity, so I created an example with some of these and they had to go at the very top, not associated with any entity at all; there are a lot of variants, and I'm wondering if we've covered enough of them
    - N: For me, having lots of labels in a simple model makes it complicated, I don't think that's the idea here
    - K: So what is your preference?
    - N: Just to have a simple label \[column\] as a constant; label is just a concept, not a technical feature or constraint, just a concept that we use to explain that specific element
    - K: So then you are saying that the shape or entity would always have to be on it's own row
- N: Always, and that is the only preference that I do have; for the same reason that we are not combining two things in one column, we should not combine two things in one row; earlier we had to separate some things into different columns to make our model more actionable and less complicated
    - K: So what does that mean for the order of the rows? It sounds like that means that the order of the rows is what associates a property with an entity
    - N: Yes. If I remember correctly the discussion was that once an entity is declared, any properties coming under that entity belong to it, until the next declared entity
    - K: I'll prepare an example and put it in the GitHub repository that redoes [the example you are seeing on the screen](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv) using a separate row for the shape, and with only one label column; I think we need to see it to discuss it
- N: There are also considerations about when a shape should be declared; in the example we see the "entity shape reference" for \@person happening prior to the statements for the person shape
    - N: In this specific example, the constraints for `dct:creator` include the "entity shape reference" for \@person, but the person shape itself isn't defined until below this; in many programming situations this wouldn't work \[referring to something, a variable for example, that has not yet been declared\]; so we may need to include in our specification whether you can declare or call shapes anywhere
    - K: You're saying the order of the shapes is not fixed?
    - N: No--the order of the definition. Say for example that person is declared at a later point than a reference to that person shape; for example here we see that \@person is referenced in the first statement \[but not declared until a subsequent row\]; so either we need to come up with a recommendation that you can declare shapes anywhere--parsers would need to handle any ordering issues--or go the conventional way, where you have to declare shapes before you can refer to them
    - K: I think you'll have to be able to declare shapes anywhere; I don't think people creating APs will be thinking of order in terms of programming; I had an example that was circular--it isn't always the case that you have an entity that is never the object
    - N: A solid specification will help implementers
    - K: I don't think we can say that you have to declare it before
    - N: That's fine, we'll have to say that in the specification...
    - K: ...that the shapes can be in any order
- N: I have another serious issue having to do with identifiers; in the last model Tom pointed out that classes are declared, for example in the last model sdo:Book was a class and I used an identifier as a URI; I have some real-world examples, let me take a screenshot and share
    - N: For example, this is from a big genetic RDF set

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/2En8zvZ.jpg)

    - K: So what are we supposed to be seeing here?
    - N: There, the gene has an identifier. The first line is the identifier of the gene; so that is actually your shape--the gene is a shape; we see this focus on interoperability because of the [FAIR model](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/); I stands for interoperability, and this involves declaring identifiers for every element, so every shape should have an identifier, this would be very important for creating an AP for FAIR data; the problem in our model so far, for such use cases we don't have an option to declare identifiers; this is a complex problem to create APs for real-world datasets and make them FAIR compatible
    - K: Wouldn't you have a property that says "identifier"?
    - N: We can, but we have to reserve that property
    - K: "Reserve that property"?
    - N: So that people cannot use "identifier" again if we say that
    - K: In your profile, you would declare that this thing has to have an identifier, and you would have, you know, `dct:identifier`
    - B: So looking again at [the example](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv), we see that for the author property there is an "entity shape reference" of \@person, and person is defined later on in this particular profile. But Nishad are you saying that instead of having the "entity shape reference" point to a shape defined in the profile, we would have as a value there an IRI for a resource that isn't in the profile, it's external--is that it?
    - N: Looking at this example, let's say that this person should have a VIAF identifier, and we don't have any option to mandate that
    - K: You are creating a profile that is going to be used for millions of metadata entities, you aren't going to be putting the person's VIAF identifier in your profile, but your profile can say that it has to have an identifier, and that the identifier has to be from VIAF, and that would be true for every person
    - N: My question is can we do that for the classes themselves? For example, for entities. My specific example is this gene--the gene is an entity, and it has an identifier to identify it
    
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/PVSTg6R.png)

    - N: I shared a simple example from PubChem chemical substances, and they have a substance ID; so how can we constrain the identifiers in these cases? These are all five-star linked data \[sources\]
    - K: We would have a property `dct:identifier`, and then we would have a IRI stem constraint, you would do it with a constraint
    - N: But you can't say it's a property; with the gene example, the identifier is the subject
    - K: It's the subject of your program, but in the way you would create this information, it's a property
    - T: I'm not sure I see what the fundamental issue is; it seems like something that could be accommodated in the current model
- N: The subject \[of the triple\] is an identifier, a URI, and we can't have any constraint for that identifier \[the subject of the triple\]; in \[?simple DSV?\] they have something called ID, which is a constrainer, ID is a reserved space, whenever there is something defined as an ID, the RDF subject has that ID, it is used to validate that ID; it's a constraint and a validator for the identifier, because \[the identifier\] is the subject \[of triples\]
    - T: Nishad, could you simplify this example and post it as an email message?
- T: I'd like to get a sense of where everyone stands with regard to saying that a shape must be on it's own row. If that's what the group feels, I can live with that, but I wonder if we could get a sense of that on this call, I think it's a pretty fundamental assumption because it doesn't make sense having "mandatory" and "repeatable" do double-duty unless you enforce having statements and shapes on different rows; the same with the label issue, I think it depends on this, and on whether the sequence then matters
    - John: Can you clarify if you mean entity by shape?
    - T: Yeah, [the document](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/40b6a5c7cb30e0b0f61a2151fa2ad00c22582f76/prototypes/simple/simpleInstance.csv) still says entity but we've been referring to it as shape ("shape ID," "shape label")
    - J and T: The first two columns
    - K: Yeah we had started [here](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/fc0876e82a675c87302b787efa91f61ff6504dce/prototypes/simple/simpleTemplate.csv) but I just hadn't done the other one
    - B: Putting a shape on it's own row allows you to define any and all constraints and annotations that you want for that shape; you can unambiguously give your label and talk about cardinality if that applies; that seems like a strong argument for saying that shapes should be on their own row; so I guess I'm for
- K: Is anybody against?
    - T: I'm weakly against, but not strongly; I can live with that; my preference would be to not have columns like mandatory and repeatable do double duty, if you really need mandatory and repeatable on a shape, then have "shape mandatory" and "shape repeatable,"" I see it as an edge case, and would be surprised if many people needed to do that; I think "property label" is clearer than just "label", and you wouldn't be able to call it a property label if we assume that the sequence of columns is arbitrary and it's ambiguous whether it's a shape label or a property label
    - J: I agree with Tom, looking back, we've always been discussing columns as they relate to properties; I would need to see some examples of things that we want to say about shapes that couldn't be said as an aspect of a property; there is no top-level entity, maybe that is part of the issue, I suppose if you need to say that my top-level entity needs to have a particular shape that's where you run out of room I guess, where expressing something as an aspect of a property doesn't work; I just need to see some examples of things that we want to say about shapes
    - P: When you've got two different shapes that relate to people--for example the author versus the owner of a book--you'd need different labels and different annotations to explain that
    - K: I'd like to see that as an example; I'm not quite sure how that would work; Phil could you do an example?
    - P: I put it in chat, it's [that one there](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/fc0876e82a675c87302b787efa91f61ff6504dce/prototypes/bookclub/ap.csv)
    - P: You need at least one owner and one book, so both would be mandatory and repeatable, they have different labels, you'd probably also want them to have different comments
    - K: Why is that not possible on [lines 13 and 14](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/fc0876e82a675c87302b787efa91f61ff6504dce/prototypes/bookclub/ap.csv#L13) where you have the properties?
    - P: There's a difference between annotating the property for author and the entity author, because \[the annotations will\] show up in a different place in a form or a display; with an owner for example, they might not own any books (owner could be read as book club member) so they might not show up as the values of any property
    - K: So \@owner might not be linked to from anything? 
- K: I am going to make a list of examples that we need and insist that folks provide them
    - K: Again I'll try to summarize where we are with this; I do think that we are at separate rows \[for shapes and statements\], so we can look at advantages and disadvantages and see whether we feel comfortable with that; I guess we don't want to have it be optional either way
    - K: We're meeting every two weeks
