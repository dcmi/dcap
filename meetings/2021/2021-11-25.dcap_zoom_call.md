## Agenda 

### Announcements

* [DCAT-AP 2.1.0](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/blob/2.1.0-draft/releases/2.1.0/dcat-ap_2.1.0.pdf) in progress. Karen will update the example.
* edited [readme](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/README.md) to include implementations
* ? anything else?

### Work on Primer

* on [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/DErWH403RaWiBippMFosaw) for easier commenting
* [through cardinality](https://github.com/kcoyle/dcap/commit/9fec61a9e3763991f907741cfdf91b7381def268#diff-28cc19f2013c7b9e915c4c8a3ac5b2c668e8a02e5c6852dd027cfbed2e1be01b)
* [value constraints and shape](https://github.com/kcoyle/dcap/commit/6b997c563baf279a62cbb35928c9a4ef81b841d6#diff-28cc19f2013c7b9e915c4c8a3ac5b2c668e8a02e5c6852dd027cfbed2e1be01b)
* Does this satisfy [issue #35](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/35)?

### Beginning implementation document
* https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/ImplementingTAP.md
* copied over namespace info from primer
* did a section on validation - here, or the cookbook?

## Minutes

* added implementation section to readme

**Primer updates**

kc: changes in kcoyle github repo and coordinated with hackmd version. comments can be done on hackmd.

kc: document reorganized to keep statements together. appendices may be deleted later

kc: many editorial changes. asking Tom: does this satisfy issue #35.

tom: header Statements header - statements are in data; in tap they are constraints

ACTION: "Constraints on statements, their properties, and values"

ACTION: each 

cardinality: = statement cardinality?

kc: edits on property values and shapes. 

tom: literal datatypes - type is not itself literal. 

phil: datatypes for literals

(checking XML document and RDF document)

ACTION: use statement from RDF document with minor edits; include links to RDF document AND XML datatype document. Add the RDF-defined values (langstring ...?) 

Note that we have a value constraint type of langstring which is the list of valid languages. Is this confusing?

Value Constraint: a pattern for the value

phil: confusion between pattern and value constraint type pattern

tom: a string is also a pattern

phil: should value constraint type be more specific and a "regex". From programming point of view you want to know exactly what the pattern is

kc: many flavors of regex. and folks may use non-regex patterns. can call them 'programmable expressions' or 'actionable expressions'

phil: folks can define a more specific type for particular types of regex

ACTION: phil to create github issue for this - change pattern to regex?

ACTION: FIX regex example which markdown munges

Shapes: kc: how do shapes in tap connect to shapes in instance data? in shacl much use of classes. 

phil: target of node shape is all nodes of specific class, or named node

kc: want a version of phil's multi-sheet tap in examples. Good example for people 

phil: could be an implmentation of TAP.

ACTION: Phil will set up google sheet that people can view

tom: implementation document should have examples with shex and shacl

phil: a standard can only standardize so much; the rest is left to implementation. Example of implementation guide:
