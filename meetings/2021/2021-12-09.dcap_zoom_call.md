## Agenda 

### Announcements

* Work continues on RDA/LRMI metadata TAP - Phil announces that there are multiple efforts in LRMI group relating to application profiles. They may form a subgroup for LRMI AP thoughts
* No word yet from DataCite, also looking at TAP
* Some outline sections added to [ImplementingTAP](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/ImplementingTAP.md)
ACTION: Karen will add a header for Phil's multiple sheet solution

### Work on Primer

* on [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/DErWH403RaWiBippMFosaw) for easier commenting
* [updates from last meeting, through line 158](https://github.com/kcoyle/dcap/commit/dc58cc199db3113c4906b846f19238aaa435c2c9#)
* [value constraints and shape](https://github.com/kcoyle/dcap/commit/6b997c563baf279a62cbb35928c9a4ef81b841d6#diff-28cc19f2013c7b9e915c4c8a3ac5b2c668e8a02e5c6852dd027cfbed2e1be01b)

## Minutes

In talking about Shapes, Tom questions use of "entity" - a metadata thing or a thing in the world. Shape is a category, not an instance. Use "type"? 

John: what are we talking about in this sentence? 

kc: what would we call the boxes in the diagram? Use resource instead of entity?

phil: no one word is going to be clear. We may need to rephrase the sentence. 

tom: (reads from his dctap-python) "statements about a distinct entity in the world is a description". Name things in instance data differently from their names in the TAP.

phil: list of metadata properties in an AP.

john: entities plural used later - type or class of entity; or an entity in a model

tom: statements expected to be found in a description. 

kc: not happy with 'description'. don't find it used in that way.

tom: we need a name for the group of statements in instance data. 

kc: we need a name for something in the metadata (instance) that describes something in the world.

john: making a model - model is an abstraction

phil: a single list of metadata properties may provide a model for describing a type of entity - entities are real world, entity types are models

property constraints - single list of properties and their constraints. single list of constraints on statements, their properties and values

kc: do we have constraints on statements, or do we have properties and their constraints, and that makes up a statement?

tom: statement is in the metadata - statement constraint is in TAP

john: I like 'properties and their constraints'. property constraints puts 'constraint' as the main noun, where as the property is the key element

tom: properties are in metadata, not tap

kc: do we need to say how the shape in the tap connects to the shape in the metadata.

phil: shapes are in the profile. but how do you connect from the shape to the metadata?

tom: could be rdf class declaration. 

phil: I don't like using the identifier of the shape to match the instance data. in shacl a shape can match a type, it can match objects or subjects of a property, or a shape can match a single instance.

kc: do an example with shapeID as a URI?

tom: No, that conflates the shapeID.

DECISION: leave as an open issue; put examples in the implementation guide.
ACTION: Tom will write a sentence about shex

john: not so much xml but databases where data is stored.

ACTION: create test instance data
