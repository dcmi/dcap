## Agenda

* Upcoming: LD4 presentation July 23
* Mention: SRAP, DataCite and DCAT work to transform to DCTAP
* DCTAP-Python - demonstration, discussion
    * Currently following the [primer](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/TAPprimer.md), and documented in [readthedocs](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    * [Basic TAP validation, issue 29](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/29) 
        * Question of allowing through unknown headers but with a warning. 
        * Allowing case insensitive etc is done
    * [TAP shape/output structure, issue 30](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/29)
        * Brings up topic of open/closed and whether a new table is needed for more definition of shapes. See [Phil's comments](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/30#issuecomment-858827013)
    * [TAP contents](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/31)
        * question on [values with white spaces](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/valueConstraintType/Picklist/index.html) in picklist
        * [pattern checks for valid regex](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/valueConstraintType/Pattern/index.html) - do we need to accommodate other kinds of patterns? Or skip regex check?
        * [IRIstem](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/valueConstraintType/IRIStem/index.html) Now can be more than one with spaces
        * [Language tag](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/valueConstraintType/LanguageTag/index.html) Multiples allowed; use of @?
        * ShapeID gets [warning if not IRI-type](https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/shapeID/index.html)

# Tests

|element|tests|
|----|----|
|TAP overall|propertyID required; exits|
|TAP headers|case insensitive; white space, _ - removed; only TAP headers output|
|propertyID|must be IRI or compact IRI|
|propertyLabel|assumed to be a single string|
|mandatory|"1/0 or true/false"|
|repeatable|"1/0 or true/false"|
|valueNodeType|"IRI or URI, Bnode, Literal; or any SHACL combined value; others get warning"|
|valueDataType|warning if not IRI; warning if IRI or BNODE given literal value|
|valueConstraint|treated as literal unless NodeType IRI/Bnode|
|valueConstraintType – picklist|splits on whitespace; question on values with internal whitespace|
|valueconstraintType – pattern|checks for valid regex|
|valueConstraintType – IRIstem|checks to see if seems like an IRI; allows more than one|
|valueConstraintType – LanguageTag|allows multiples using spaces; doesn't include “@”|
|valueShape|any warnings?|
|shapeID|if none, default is provided|
|shapeLabel|assumed to be a single string|
|note|assumed to be a single string|

* [Outputs, issue 32](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/32) Can be closed?
