Draft message to code4lib:
The Dublin Core work on tabular application profiles (DC TAP) has been published as a stable draft [1] and announced on the Dublin Core site. [2] The DC TAP has 12 elements/columns that can express the basic requirements for APs representing metadata entities, properties, property cardinality, value type, and additional constraints on value types. 

These elements fulfill basic profile needs but obviously not every possible feature of a profile. It's our hope that many more functions can be fulfilled with extensions to this simple set. The working group is creating a "cookbook" of possible solutions to additional requirements, some of which come out of this community, e.g. indicating order of values; allowing alternate value types; and others. 

We will continue to announce milestones to this channel and welcome comments and suggestions. Information on how to comment is in the draft, and links to more documents can be found in the blog post.

## Minutes

Work next on Manifest. 

#3 has just a simple table for prefixes and namespaces. Can this be extended, or is a manifest a different thing because more complex?

Tom: value of manifest is to declare info about profile for use by others, or for configuring a tool, e.g. swapping out column headings. Have we expressed requirements?

Nishad points out that there is much discussion on github issue [#3](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/3). That issue was to be about documenting prefixes and namespaces but became about the entire manifest. Nishad's comment is based on CSVW but uses a table format.

ACTION: Karen will link from #16 to #3, and will copy over [Nishad's interpretation of CSV](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/3#issuecomment-789652864) on the Web to #16. Karen will also add any interesting points from #3 to #16.

Tom suggests that we need a set of requirements.

John: Suggests OAI-ORE, and that if we keep the manifest simple it can be 1) just another tab in a spreadsheet program and 2) easily converted to any format people work with (JSON, triples, ...)

It would be good to provide more than one solution.

kc: table format gives us the same problem we had with adding prefixes to TAP: the need to maintain consistency of columns and rows. Rows with properties and values (like dct:title = "My title") differ from short name and namespace.

Options for manifests and prefix declarations are:
1. An option for prefixes only. This is a minimum because the prefix declarations are needed for processing the TAP.
2. An option that combines the prefix declarations and other information that is desired in a manifest (administrative information like authors, date of creation, etc.)
3. An option that allows a separate prefix declaration and manifest. This option makes the prefix declaration more easily re-usable.

Some questions:
1. Are there data elements we can use for the manifest+prefixes? Or do we need to create our own vocabulary?
2. Should we include an option using OAI-ORE? 
3. Should we include an option using schema.org?
4. How will we connect the TAP and the related files? 
   * Will PROF work for this? 
   * Can we use file names? 
   * URL links? 
5. Limit to tabular solutions or extend to JSON, RDF, etc.?

ACTION: John will try to mock up an OAI-ORE example. 

Nishad: We might be able to make use of both DCAT and PROF, at least in part. And we should define mapping, for example to schema.org. (for manifest, not TAP itself)
kc: Develop TAP without DCAT or PROF as constraints, but then seek compatibility where possible.
