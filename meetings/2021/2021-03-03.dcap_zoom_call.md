## Decisions

For issue #12, kc has responded:
https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/12#issuecomment-791597662

For issue #13, we agreed that multiple value shapes are ok. Information about properties that can take multiple values will be added to the documentation. (Note: it seems that this fits best into the primer, because it may confuse even more the cardinality in the vocabulary document which refers to the TAP properties not their values)

For issue #14, most felt that ordering may be out of scope. However, there are two ordering aspects: ordering of properties and ordering of values (objects of a property). For the latter, the table can only indicate that values must be ordered. This triggers the use of an array or a list (depending on the programming language or data schema). This could be handled with a single column with a binary value: ordered, not ordered. Ordering the properties themselves may be more complex. Within a shape, properties could be given an order number, but the question is whether shapes themselves need to be ordered. This is unresolved.
