## Minutes

For draft:
* Implement Tom's comments:

- Profile Overview, first sentence: I suggest using "schema" 
  instead of "scheme". In DC usage, "scheme" was always only 
  ever used for "Encoding Schemes" - a usage that was picked 
  up in "SKOS Concept Scheme".

- Section "Properties": suggest changing 

    http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_familyName

  to

    http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/familyName
 
  which is both best practice and in line with the 
  prefix exammple in the section "Namespace Declarations".

- valueDataType: The CSV example does not display, perhaps 
  because the second row has one column too many.

- valueNodeType: suggest changing

    It can be IRI, blank node or literal.

    to:

    Valid keywords are "IRI", "bnode", and "literal" (case-insensitive).

* Change examples to have "bnode" and "literal" in lower case

* Change title to DC Tabular Application Profiles (DC TAP)
* Rollout requires a blog post - Karen will draft shortly
* Plan rollout of document and blog post (and other announcements) for after April 14 meeting.
* Karen: check vocabulary doc for needed changes
* Add an introduction to the TAP document saying where to comment (github or email list)
* Consider a new document, a "cookbook", for issues like:
  * ordering
  * multiple entries in a cell
  * open/closed
  * and other "implementation issues"
  * Karen: get back to Justin to see if our suggestions have helped him

* Code:
    * Tom: will create a module that does basic checking of TAP. This will need to be documented (either in vocabulary document or some other document)
    * Karen: volunteers to create test data
