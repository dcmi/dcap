    * Is primer ready to be updated on DC site?

* Examples compatible with github.io [see](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/tree/main/examples)
    * Do a few more? How many? Which?
    * Ayy! Many examples on DCAP/prototypes. Those need to be gone through. Copy over any that can be DCTAP examples (after modifications). Delete others so that DCAP directory is not redundant with DCTAP
* What next? Any possibility to get further on programs? Also see: Also see: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dcmi/dctap2shex/
    * Shex and shacl transforms are alpha (or maybe beta) and can be offered to coders to fork.
    * Tom's dctap-python might be ready for huggingface, but is definitely ready to be used by others.
    * These can be advertised on coder-adjacent lists, with a request to return any improvements
