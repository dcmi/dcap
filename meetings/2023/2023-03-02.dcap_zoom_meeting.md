## Agenda

* News piece for DC website [here](https://hackmd.io/xStNjvZESJOYTwu6-CoshA)

Dublin Core Metadata Initiative announces a stable version of DCTAP, a table-based model for the expression of application profiles. With only twelve elements, this model provides an extensible core that can be used to define, constrain, and explain the expected metadata usage. 

Specifications for DCTAP are available on the DC web site.[link] Community members are encouraged to share their experience with DCTAP through the Application Profiles Working Group email[link], or the DCTAP github repository[link].)
    kc: send to webmanager
* Content ideas for blog post? https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/
    * to be worked on
* SRAP DCTAP and new [issue #90](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/issues/90) - IRI stems for propertyID
    * it may be that this can only be done in user documentation
    * may related to open/closed, which we haven't resolved
    * there could be an additional column, but that would mean that in that case propertyID is not required
    * may also relate to the definition of namespaces; could say that included namespaces relate to open/closed; only terms in the namespaces are allowed; could namespace mean: use anything from example.com
        * tom: not clear how you would validate this
        * phil: like schema.org with http and https; make sure that every property can be foundk
    * basically decide that this is a form of guidance; but guidance is not machine-processable
    * maybe this is a profile of the profile
* Have a look at Schemasheets [https://linkml.io/schemasheets/](https://linkml.io/schemasheets/)
    * sounds good, but no one fully understands it
* Anyone going to SWIB23? SWIB23 15th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference, Berlin, 11-13 Sept. [http://swib.org/swib23/](http://swib.org/swib23/)
    * phil: maybe do a session on APs for learning resources
* profiles vs application profiles - everyone starts with very general ideas
    * tom: would be too bad if dctap couldn't be used for rapid prototyping
* Back to cookbook
