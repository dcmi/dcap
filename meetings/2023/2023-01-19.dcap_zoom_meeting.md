## Agenda

* Report out from SEMIC meeting
    * Tom reports: UML diagram is source of truth; UML to be start of workflow, which limits the diagraming. That is a kind of a profile of UML. Phil: statements are about SHACL shapes. Problem is in the different meanings of "class". Have to abide by underlying vocabulary definitions. "Light-weight ontology" for them is OWL lite. But also "can't cherry pick". 
    * john: DDI cross-domain specification has UML as 'truth'
    * phil: problem with UML is it is closely aligned with object-oriented programming. DCTAP could be the single source of truth. esp. because doesn't use symbols
* Review [bits](https://hackmd.io/8mgSE3UfTwCMoJ49Yl9IVw) for web site
    * Nishad: drop-down not needed; it will be under /specifications
    * group is application profiles, product is DCTAP
    * two short documents were completed during meeting
    * 
* Longer [web site page](https://hackmd.io/qpBNn0dbR_ypypgLHX4BYw)
* Tom: put name of document first in bullet points
* nishad: add a tsv starter file

ACTION: remove dctap.ttl since we aren't doing a vocabulary (kc to put in her own repo)

Phil: extended TAP template - will move to tap to shacl.
